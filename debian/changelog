  * Merge from Debian unstable, remaining changes:
    - debian/libpam-modules.postinst: Add PATH to /etc/environment if it's
      not present there or in /etc/security/pam_env.conf. (should send to
      Debian).
    - debian/libpam0g.postinst: only ask questions during update-manager when
      there are non-default services running.
    - debian/libpam0g.postinst: check if gdm is actually running before
      trying to reload it.
    - debian/libpam0g.postinst: the init script for 'samba' is now named
      'smbd' in Ubuntu, so fix the restart handling.
    - Change Vcs-Bzr to point at the Ubuntu branch.
    - debian/patches-applied/series: Ubuntu patches are as below ...
    - debian/patches-applied/ubuntu-rlimit_nice_correction: Explicitly
      initialise RLIMIT_NICE rather than relying on the kernel limits.
    - debian/patches-applied/pam_umask_usergroups_from_login.defs.patch:
      Deprecate pam_unix' explicit "usergroups" option and instead read it
      from /etc/login.def's "USERGROUP_ENAB" option if umask is only defined
      there. This restores compatibility with the pre-PAM behaviour of login.
    - debian/patches-applied/pam_motd-legal-notice: display the contents of
      /etc/legal once, then set a flag in the user's homedir to prevent
      showing it again.
    - debian/update-motd.5, debian/libpam-modules.manpages: add a manpage
      for update-motd, with some best practices and notes of explanation.
    - debian/patches/update-motd-manpage-ref: add a reference in pam_motd(8)
      to update-motd(5)
    - debian/local/common-session{,-noninteractive}: Enable pam_umask by
      default, now that the umask setting is gone from /etc/profile.
    - debian/local/pam-auth-update: Add the new md5sums for pam_umask addition.

pam (1.1.3-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches-applied/hurd_no_setfsuid: we don't want to check all
    setre*id() calls; we know that there are situations where some of these
    may fail but we don't care.  As long as the last setre*id() call in each
    set succeeds, that's the state we mean to be in.
  * debian/libpam0g.postinst: according to Kubuntu developers, kdm no longer
    keeps libpam loaded persistently at runtime, so it's not necessary to
    force a kdm restart on ABI bump.  Which is good, since restarting kdm
    now seems to also log users out of running sessions, which we rather
    want to avoid.  Closes: #632673, LP: #744944.

  * debian/libpam0g.templates, debian/libpam0g.postinst: add a new question,

    service restarts once for all so that they don't have to repeatedly
    say "ok".  LP: #745004.
  * debian/libpam-runtime.templates, debian/local/pam-auth-update: add a

      bump the hard limit for number of file descriptors, to keep pace with
      the changes in the kernel.

    - debian/libpam0g.postinst: check if gdm is actually running before
      trying to reload it.
    - New patch, lib_security_multiarch_compat, which lets us reuse the
      upstream --enable-isadir functionality to support a true path for
      module lookups; this way we don't have to force a hard transition to
      multiarch, but can support resolving modules in both the multiarch and
      non-multiarch directories.
    - build for multiarch, splitting our executables out of libpam-modules
      into a new package, libpam-modules-bin, so that modules can be
      co-installable between architectures.
    - bumping the service restart version in libpam0g.postinst to ensure
      servers don't fail to find the pam modules in the new paths.
  * bump debhelper build-dep for final multiarch support.

    /etc/pam.d/common-password, convert them on upgrade to 'minlen=n' for
    compatibility with upstream.
  * debian/NEWS: document the disappearance of 'min=n', in case users have
    encoded this option elsewhere outside of /etc/pam.d/common-password.

    - debian/patches-applied/ubuntu-regression_fix_securetty: prompt for
      password on bad username.
    - debian/patches-applied/ubuntu-rlimit_nice_correction: Explicitly
      initialise RLIMIT_NICE rather than relying on the kernel limits.
    - Change Vcs-Bzr to point at the Ubuntu branch.
    - Make libpam-modules depend on base-files (>= 5.0.0ubuntu6), to ensure

  * debian/patches/pam_securetty_tty_check_before_user_check: new patch,
    to make pam_securetty always return success on a secure tty regardless
    of what username was passed.  Thanks to Nicolas François
    <nicolas.francois@centraliens.net> for the patch.  Closes: #537848
  * debian/local/pam-auth-update: only reset the seen flag on the template
    when there's new information; this avoids reprompting users for the same
    information on upgrade, regardless of the debconf priority used.
    Closes: #544805.
  * libpam0g no longer depends on libpam-runtime; packages that use
    /etc/pam.d/common-* must depend directly on libpam-runtime, and most do
    (including the Essential: yes ones), so let's break this circular
    dependency.  Closes: #545086, LP: #424566.

pam (1.1.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bump debian/compat to 7, so we can use sane contents in debian/*.install
  * Switch all packages over to dh_install
  * Rename debian/*.lintian to debian/*.lintian-overrides and use dh_lintian
  * Move installation logic out of debian/rules into individual .install
    files
  * Drop superfluous options to dh_installchangelogs, dh_shlibdeps
  * Use debian/clean instead of rm -f'ing files in debian/rules clean target
  * Drop ./configure options that are no-ops
  * Drop the /lib/security/pam_unix_*.so symlinks, which have been deprecated
    now for 10 years and are not used at all if pam-auth-update is in play.
  * Drop the pam_rhosts_auth.so symlink as well, and document in NEWS.Debian
    that this is now obsolete.
  * Drop stale content from README.debian: some of this should have been in
    NEWS.Debian instead (but is so old it's not worth putting it there now),
    some of it is obsolete by the change in package VCS.
  * Convert debian/rules to debhelper 7 and add versioned build-dependencies
    on debhelper and quilt to suit.
  * Drop CFLAGS that we don't need anymore (-fPIC, -D_REENTRANT,
    -D_GNU_SOURCE).
  * Explicitly add -O0 to CFLAGS when noopt is set.
  * debian/patches/autoconf.patch: pull ltmain.sh in, to fix some spurious
    library linkage in the modules.
  * Move pam_cracklib manpage to the libpam-cracklib package, and add the
    requisite Replaces
  * Drop dh_makeshlibs -V; everything from lenny on should use the .symbols
    file instead, making the shlibs redundant so we don't need to care what
    version gets listed there.

  * debian/patches/pam_unix_dont_trust_chkpwd_caller.patch: fix this patch
    to call setregid() instead of always returning an error on username
    mismatch in unix_chkpwd, needed in the SELinux case and in some corner
    cases with the broken_shadow option.  Thanks to Michael Spang for the
    analysis.  Closes: #543589.
  * fix the PAM mini-policy to not tell app maintainers that they don't need
    to depend on libpam-modules if they reference modules from there.
  * make libpam-runtime depend on libpam-modules (>= 1.0.1-6) - nothing else
    guarantees that we have pam_unix available for use by pam-auth-update.
  * Use /bin/sh instead of /bin/bash for libpam0g.postinst, since we've
    confirmed there are no longer any bashisms there.  Closes: #519973.
  * Clean up the libpam0g postinst a bit; invoke-rc.d has been a guaranteed

  * Trim pam.d-manpage-section patch, which was mostly but not completely
    applied upstream.
  * Update debian/libpam0g.symbols for new extension.
  * Bump the shlibs version as well, for our dpkg-shlibdeps fallback.
  * And bump the version checks in the libpam-modules {pre,post}inst, so that
    the necessary services get restarted for any modules that need the new
    symbols.

pam (1.0.1-7ubuntu1) jaunty; urgency=low

  * Merge from Debian unstable
  * Remaining changes:
    - debian/libpam-modules.postinst: Add PATH to /etc/environment if it's not
      present there or in /etc/security/pam_env.conf. (should send to Debian).
    - debian/libpam0g.postinst: only ask questions during update-manager when
      there are non-default services running.
    - debian/patches-applied/series: Ubuntu patches are as below ...
    - debian/patches-applied/ubuntu-fix_standard_types: Use standard u_int8_t
      type rather than __u8.
    - debian/patches-applied/ubuntu-no-error-if-missingok: add a new, magic
      module option 'missingok' which will suppress logging of errors by
      libpam if the module is not found.
    - debian/patches-applied/ubuntu-regression_fix_securetty: prompt for
      password on bad username.
    - debian/patches-applied/ubuntu-rlimit_nice_correction: Explicitly
      initialise RLIMIT_NICE rather than relying on the kernel limits.
    - debian/patches-applied/ubuntu-user_defined_environment: Look at
      ~/.pam_environment too, with the same format as
      /etc/security/pam_env.conf.  (Originally patch 100; converted to quilt.)
    - Change Vcs-Bzr to point at the Ubuntu branch.
    - debian/local/common-password, debian/pam-configs/unix: switch from
      "md5" to "sha512" as password crypt default.
  * Dropped changes, merged in Debian:
    - debian/local/pam-auth-update (et al): new interface for managing
      /etc/pam.d/common-*, using drop-in config snippets provided by module
      packages.
    - New patch dont_freeze_password_chain, cherry-picked from upstream:
      don't always follow the same path through the password stack on
      the PAM_UPDATE_AUTHTOK pass as was used in the PAM_PRELIM_CHECK
      pass; this Linux-PAM deviation from the original PAM spec causes a
      number of problems, in particular causing wrong return values when
      using the refactored pam-auth-update stack.  LP: #303515, #305882.
    - debian/patches/027_pam_limits_better_init_allow_explicit_root:
      Add documentation to the patch showing how to set limits for root.
  * Bump the libpam-cracklib dependency on libpam-runtime to 1.0.1-6,
    reducing the delta with Debian.
  * Drop upgrade handling code from libpam-runtime.postinst that's only
    needed when upgrading from 1.0.1-2ubuntu1, a superseded intrepid
    pre-release version of the package.
  * pam-auth-update: swap out known md5sums from intrepid pre-release versions
    with the md5sums from the released intrepid version
  * pam-auth-update: drop some md5sums that will only be seen on upgrade from
    pre-intrepid versions; skipping over the 8.10 final release is not
    supported, and upgrading via 8.10 means those config files will be
    replaced so the old md5sums will never be seen again.

  * 027_pam_limits_better_init_allow_explicit_root:
    - fix the patch so that our limit resets are actually *applied*, 
      which has apparently been broken for who knows how long!
    - shadow the finite kernel defaults for RLIMIT_SIGPENDING and
      RLIMIT_MSGQUEUE as well, so that the preceding change doesn't
      suddenly expose systems to DoS or other issues.
    - include documentation in the patch, giving examples of how to set 
      limits for root.  Thanks to Jonathan Marsden.
  * pam-auth-update: swap out known md5sums from intrepid pre-release 
    versions with the md5sums from the released intrepid version

    Closes: #493283.  As a side-effect, pam_unix no longer logs any warnings
    about NULL password + insecure tty, but I don't think this is critical.

pam (1.0.1-1ubuntu1) intrepid; urgency=low

  * Merge from Debian unstable
  * Dropped changes:
    - Linux-PAM/modules/pam_selinux/pam_selinux.8: Ubuntu pam_selinux manpage
      is 2 years newer than Debian's, contains a number of character escaping
      fixes plus content updates
    - debian/patches-applied/ubuntu-pam_selinux_seusers: patch pam_selinux to
      correctly support seusers (backported from changes in PAM 0.99.8).  
    - debian/rules: install unix_chkpwd setgid shadow instead of setuid root.
      The nis package handles overriding this as necessary.
    - debian/patches-applied/ubuntu-rlimit_nice_correction: Bound RLIMIT_NICE
      from below as well as from above. Fix off-by-one error when converting
      RLIMIT_NICE to the range of values used by the kernel.
  * Remaining changes:
    - debian/libpam-modules.postinst: Add PATH to /etc/environment if it's not
      present there or in /etc/security/pam_env.conf. (should send to Debian).
    - debian/libpam-runtime.postinst,
      debian/local/common-{auth,password}{,.md5sums}:
      Use the new 'missingok' option by default for pam_smbpass in case
      libpam-smbpass is not installed (LP: #216990); must use "requisite"
      rather than "required" to prevent "pam_smbpass migrate" from firing in
      the event of an auth failure; md5sums updated accordingly.
    - debian/libpam0g.postinst: only ask questions during update-manager when
      there are non-default services running.
    - debian/patches-applied/series: Ubuntu patches are as below ...
    - debian/patches-applied/ubuntu-fix_standard_types: Use standard u_int8_t
      type rather than __u8.
    - debian/patches-applied/ubuntu-no-error-if-missingok: add a new, magic
      module option 'missingok' which will suppress logging of errors by
      libpam if the module is not found.
    - debian/patches-applied/ubuntu-regression_fix_securetty: prompt for
      password on bad username.
    - debian/patches-applied/ubuntu-rlimit_nice_correction: Explicitly
      initialise RLIMIT_NICE rather than relying on the kernel limits.
    - debian/patches-applied/ubuntu-user_defined_environment: Look at
      ~/.pam_environment too, with the same format as
      /etc/security/pam_env.conf.  (Originally patch 100; converted to quilt.)
  * Refresh patch ubuntu-no-error-if-missingok for the new upstream version.
  * Change Vcs-Bzr to point at the new Ubuntu branch.

pam (1.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
    - pam_limits: bound RLIMIT_NICE from below. Closes: #403718.
    - pam_mail: set the MAIL variable even when .hushlogin is set.
      Closes: #421010.
    - new minclass option introduced for pam_cracklib.  Closes: #454237.
    - fix a failure to check the string length when matching usernames in
      pam_group.  Closes: #444427.
    - fix setting shell security context in pam_selinux.  Closes: #451722.
    - use --disable-audit, to avoid libaudit being linked in
      accidentally
    - pam_unix now supports SHA-256 and SHA-512 password hashes.
      Closes: #484249, LP: #245786.
    - pam_rhosts_auth is dropped upstream (closes: #382987); add a compat
      symlink to pam_rhosts to support upgrades for a release, and give a
      warning in NEWS.Debian.
    - new symbol in libpam.so.0, pam_modutil_audit_write; shlibs bump, and
      do another round of service restarts on upgrade.
    - pam_unix helper is now called whenever an unprivileged process
      tries and fails to query a user's account status.  Closes: #367834.
  * Drop patches 006_docs_cleanup, 015_hurd_portability,
    019_pam_listfile_quiet, 024_debian_cracklib_dict_path, 038_support_hurd,
    043_pam_unix_unknown_user_not_alert, 046_pam_group_example,
    no_pthread_mutexes, limits_wrong_strncpy, misc_conv_allow_sigint.patch,
    pam_tally_audit.patch, 057_pam_unix_passwd_OOM_check, and
    065_pam_unix_cracklib_disable which have been merged upstream.
  * Patch 022_pam_unix_group_time_miscfixes: partially merged upstream;
    now is really just "pam_group_miscfixes".
  * Patch 007_modules_pam_unix partially superseded upstream; stripping
    hpux-style expiry information off of password fields is now supported.
  * New patch pam_unix_thread-safe_save_old_password.patch, to make sure all
    our getpwnam() use in pam_unix is thread-safe (fixes an upstream
    regression)
  * New patch pam_unix_fix_sgid_shadow_auth.patch, fixing an upstream
    regression which prevents sgid shadow apps from being able to authenticate
    any more because the module forces use of the helper and the helper won't
    allow authentication of arbitrary users.  This change does mean we're
    going to be noisier for the time being in an SELinux environment, which
    should be addressed but is not a regression on Debian.
  * New patch pam_unix_dont_trust_chkpwd_caller.patch, rolling back an
    upstream change that causes unix_chkpwd to assume that setuid(getuid())
    is sufficient to drop permissions and attempt any authentication on
    behalf of the user.
  * The password-changing helper functionality for SELinux systems has been
    split out into a separate unix_update binary, so at long last we can
    change unix_chkpwd to be sgid shadow instead of suid root.
    Closes: #155583.
    - Update the lintian override to match.
  * Install the new unix_update helper into libpam-modules.
  * Use a pristine upstream tarball instead of repacking; requires various
    changes to debian/rules and debhelper files.
  * Replace the Vcs-Svn field with a Vcs-Bzr field; jumping ship from svn,
    and how!
  * Debconf translations:
    - Romanian, thanks to Igor Stirbu <igor.stirbu@gmail.com>
      (closes: #491821)
  * Add libpam0g.symbols, for finer-grained package dependencies with
    dpkg-gensymbols.
  * Fix debian/copyright to list the known copyright holders
  * Fix up the doc-base sections for the libpam-doc documentation, "Apps"
    should not be part of the section name
  * Also fix up whitespace issues in the doc-base abstracts
  * Fix a typo in the libpam0g-dev description.
  * 027_pam_limits_better_init_allow_explicit_root: RLIM_INFINITY is also
    invalid for RLIMIT_NOFILE, so when resetting the limits for a new session,
    use the kernel default of 1024 instead.  Closes: #404836.
  * Create /etc/environment on initial install of libpam-modules (or on
    upgrade from an old version), to quell warnings in the logs about it
    being missing.  Closes: #442049.
  * 026_pam_unix_passwd_unknown_user: drop a redundant, and broken, check for
    the NSS source of our user; this was preventing password changes for NIS
    users, which otherwise should have worked.  Closes: #203222, LP: #9224.
  * New patch do_not_check_nis_accidentally: respect the 'nis' option
    (set or unset) when looking up the user's password entry for password
    changes.  Thanks to Quentin Godfroy <godfroy@clipper.ens.fr> for the
    patch.  Closes: #469635.
  * Drop patch 049_pam_unix_sane_locking, which upon review is not needed;
    it reduces the length of time we hold the lock, but at the expense of
    being able to enforce minimum times between password changes.
  * debian/watch: upstream has hit 1.0, so we're no longer in a "pre"
    directory.  Fix up the regex for uscan.
  * Fix the libpam0g-dev examples directory to not include a gratuitous
    .cvsignore file.
  * New patch, pam.d-manpage-section, to fix the manpage references to
    point to section 5 instead of section 8.
  * Update patch PAM-manpage-section to fix the references to pam(7) from
    other manpages.  Closes: #470137.
  * Add debian/README.source documenting that this package uses quilt.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.0.
  * Fix a bug in the uid-restoring code in the hurd_no_setfsuid patch; thanks
    to Tomas Mraz <tmraz@redhat.com> for indirectly bringing this to my
    attention

  * Drop -DCRACKLIB_DICTS from CFLAGS, since the referenced define is no

pam (0.99.7.1-6ubuntu1) intrepid; urgency=low

  * Merge from debian unstable
  * Dropped changes:
    - Linux-PAM/modules/pam_limits/README,
      Linux-PAM/modules/pam_selinux/README: Ubuntu versions had some
      insignificant character differences, dropping in favor of Debian
      versions; pam_selinux documentation has dropped "multiple", and added
      "select_context", and "use_current_range" as options.
    - debian/control, debian/local/common-session{,md5sums}: use
      libpam-foreground for session management.

      Without this patch login will not get correct security context when 
      using libselinux >= 1.27.2 (LP: #187822).
    - debian/patches-applied/ubuntu-regression_fix_securetty: securetty's
      earlier behavior would correctly prompt for password on bad usernames
      (LP: #139075).
    - debian/patches-applied/ubuntu-rlimit_nice_correction: Explicitly

      The nis package handles overriding this as necessary.
  * Alphabetized this merge changelog entry by filename (easier reading
    against Ubuntu patch).

      type rather than __u8.
    - debian/patches-applied/ubuntu-rlimit_nice_correction: Explicitly
      initialise RLIMIT_NICE rather than relying on the kernel limits. Bound
      RLIMIT_NICE from below as well as from above. Fix off-by-one error when
      converting RLIMIT_NICE to the range of values used by the kernel.
      (Originally patch 101; converted to quilt.)

  * Dropped:
    - debian/rules: bashism fixes (merged upstream).
    - debian/control: Conflict on ancient nis (expired with Breezy).
    - debian/libpam-runtime.postinst: check for ancient pam (expired with
      Breezy).

pam (0.99.7.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * libpam0g.postinst, libpam0g.templates: gdm doesn't need to be restarted
    to fix the library skew, only reloaded; special-case this daemon in the
    postinst and remove the mention of it from the debconf template, also
    tightening the language of the debconf template in the process.
    Closes: #440074.
  * Add courier-authdaemon to the list of services that need to be
    restarted; thanks to Micah Anderson for reporting.
  * New patch pam_env_ignore_garbage.patch: fix pam_env to really skip over
    garbage lines in /etc/environment and log an error, instead of failing
    with an obscure error; and ignore any PAM_BAD_ITEM values returned
    by pam_putenv(), since this is the expected error return when trying
    to delete a non-existent var.  Closes: #439984.
  * Yet another thinko in hurd_no_setfsuid and in
    029_pam_limits_capabilities; this code should really be Hurd-safe at
    last...
  * getline() returns -1 on EOF, not 0; check this appropriately, to fix
    an infinite loop in pam_rhosts_auth.  Thanks to Stephan Springl
    <springl-rhosts@bfw-online.de> for the fix.  Closes: #440019.
  * Use ${misc:Depends} for libpam0g, so we get a proper dependency on
    debconf.
  * 019_pam_listfile_quiet: per discussion with upstream, don't suppress
    errors about missing files or files with wrong permissions; these are
    real errors that should not be buried.
  * Drop the remainder of 061_pam_issue_double_free, not required for the
    original bugfix.
  * Drop patch 064_pam_unix_cracklib_dictpath, which is not needed now that
    we define CRACKLIB_DICTS in debian/rules.
  * Drop patch 063_paswd_segv, superseded by a different upstream fix
  * Split 047_pam_limits_chroot_string_value up between
    008_modules_pam_limits_chroot and 029_pam_limits_capabilites
  * Updates to patch 007_modules_pam_unix: restore the same built-in min
    password len of 6 that upstream uses; fix a typo panlindrome ->
    palindrome.
  * The 'max=' option was never intended to be used to limit maximum password
    length for users, only to declare what the number of significant
    characters /is/ for a password.  But we don't need a config option to
    tell us that, we know the answer based on which crypt type we're using,
    so drop this as a config file option.  Closes: #389197.
  * Debconf translations:
    - Spanish, thanks to Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña <jfs@debian.org>
    - Vietnamese, thanks to Clytie Siddall <clytie@riverland.net.au>
    - German, thanks to Sven Joachim <svenjoac@gmx.de> (closes: #440355)
    - Czech, thanks to Miroslav Kure <kurem@upcase.inf.upol.cz>
      (closes: #440362)
    - Portuguese, thanks to Américo Monteiro <a_monteiro@netcabo.pt>

pam (0.99.7.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * New patch limits_wrong_strncpy: fix unnecessary manipulations of string
    buffers, including an illegal use of strncpy().  Thanks to Paul Hampson
    for reporting.  Closes: #331278.
  * New patch misc_conv_allow_sigint.patch: allow SIGINT to be handled by the
    application, instead of blocking it when misc_conv is in use and
    preventing users from being able to ^C at any PAM prompt.  Closes: #1708.
  * 024_debian_cracklib_dict_path: default to NULL instead of a specific
    dictionary path when none is defined for consistency with the new upstream
    version of cracklib, and define our path in debian/rules.
  * 055_pam_unix_nullok_secure: document the pam_unix "nullok_secure" option,
    a prereq for forwarding this patch upstream.  Closes: #325974.
  * Create /etc/security/opasswd on new installs or on upgrades from
    0.99.7.1-2 or below, so that users that enable the remember=<n> option to
    pam_unix aren't left unable to change passwords.  Closes: #95324.
  * Fix a couple of thinkos in hurd_no_setfsuid, that were preventing the code
    from compiling on the Hurd still.  Thanks to Michael Banck for the catch.
  * Fix a memory leak in the pam_limits capabilities patch: always
    cap_free() the cap_t before returning from pam_sm_open_session().
    Closes: #153157.
  * libpam0g.postinst, libpam0g.templates: on upgrades from versions
    prior to 0.99.7.1-3, restart known PAM-using services so that they
    get the new libpam symbols, since otherwise the newer PAM modules
    will fail to load.  Postinst taken from libssl0.9.8; thanks to
    Christoph Martin for the fine example!  Closes: #439835.
  * Build-depend on po-debconf to support l10n of the debconf questions
    from the above.

pam (0.99.7.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release; thanks to Roger Leigh and Jan Christoph Nordholz
    for their extensive work in helping to prepare for this update in Debian.
    Closes: #360460.
    - now uses autoconf for library detection, so SELinux should not be
      unconditionally enabled on non-Linux archs.  Closes: #333141.
    - pam_mail notice handling has been completely reworked, so there should
      no longer be missing spaces in the messages.  Closes: #119689.
    - with libtool and autoconf, now behaves "sensibly" on unknown
      platforms.  Closes: #165067.
    - the source now builds without warnings.  Closes: #212165.
    - uses automake instead of hand-rolled makefiles with indentation
      bugs.  Closes: #241661, #328084.
    - pam_mkhomedir now creates directories recursively as needed.
      Closes: #178225.
    - pam_listfile now supports being used as a session module too.
      Closes: #416665.
    - misspelled pam_userdb log message has been corrected.  Closes: #305058.
    - the current pam_strerror manpage no longer mentions "Unknown
      Linux-PAM error".  Closes: #220157.
    - the text documentation no longer uses ANSI bold sequences.
      Closes: #181451.
    - pam_localuser now supports being used as a session module.
      Closes: #412484.
    - package no longer fails to build with dash as /bin/sh.
      Closes: #331208.
    - All modules should now be documented in the system administrator
      guide.  Closes: #350620.
    - pam_userdb now logs an error instead of segfaulting when no db=
      option is provided.  Closes: #436005.
    - pam_time now warns on a missing tty instead of erroring out,
      making it possible to use the module with non-console services.
      Closes: #127931.
    - upstream changelog is now 'ChangeLog' instead of 'CHANGELOG'; install
      accordingly
    - bump the shlibs
    - the 'test.c' example no longer exists
    - add /usr/share/locale to libpam-runtime.
    - CVE-2005-2977: only uid=0 is allowed to invoke unix_chkpwd with an
      arbitrary username, and then only when SELinux is active.
      Closes: #336344.
  * Mark myself as primary maintainer as previously discussed with Sam, and
    add Roger as an uploader.
  * Refactor to use quilt.
  * Update to Standards-Version 3.7.2.
  * Drop unnecessary build-dependency on patch, which is
    build-essential (and no longer invoked directly).
  * Drop patches 002_debian_no_ldconfig_call, 010_pam_cplusplus,
    018_man_fixes, 030_makefile_link_against_libpam,
    037_pam_issue_ttyname_can_be_null, 044_configure_supports_bsd,
    050_configure_in_gnu and 052_pam_unix_no_openlog, which have been
    superseded upstream.
  * Drop patches 005_pam_limits_099_6,
    012_pam_group_less_restrictive_charset, 023_pam_env_limits_miscfixes,
    048_pam_group_colon_valid_char, 058_pam_env_enable, 059_pam_userdb_segv,
    060_pam_tally_segv and 062_c++_safe_headers, which have been integrated
    upstream.
  * Patch 057: SELinux support is merged upstream, leaving only an
    unrelated OOM check for pam_unix_passwd.  Rename as
    057_pam_unix_passwd_OOM_check.
  * Patches 006, 008, 036: update for the switch from SGML to XML.
  * Patch 007: update for the switch from SGML to XML; drop some log
    messages that were already added upstream; update for the pam_modutil
    changes; tighten the flag handling of the 'obscure' option; drop bogus
    check in unix_chkpwd for null passwords.  Also fix a grammar error
    along the way.  Closes: #362855.
  * Patch 024: CRACKLIB_DICTPATH is no longer set in configure.in, so patch
    pam_cracklib.c instead to use the default dictpath already available
    from crack.h; and patch configure.in to use AC_CHECK_HEADERS instead
    of AC_CHECK_HEADER, so crack.h is actually included.  Also remove
    unnecessary string copies, which break on the Hurd due to PATH_MAX.
  * Patch 038: partially merged/superseded upstream; also add new Hurd
    fix for pam_xauth.
  * Patch 061: partially merged upstream
  * Use ${binary:Version} instead of ${Source-Version} in
    debian/control.
  * Remove empty maintainer scripts debian/libpam0g-dev.{postinst,prerm},
    debian/libpam0g.{postinst,prerm}, and
    debian/libpam-modules.{postinst,prerm}; debhelper can autogenerate these
    just fine without our help.
  * Build-Depend on xsltproc, libxml2-utils, docbook-xml, docbook-xsl
    and w3m instead of on linuxdoc-tools, linuxdoc-tools-latex, tetex-extra,
    groff, and opensp.
  * Also build-depend on flex for libfl.a.
  * Updates for documentation handling:
    - move debian/local/pam-*-guide to debian/libpam-doc.doc-base.foo-guide,
      and invoke dh_installdocs instead of installing these by hand.
    - drop libpam-doc.{postinst,prerm}, which are no longer needed.
    - add an install target to debian/rules, and have binary-indep depend on
      it instead of trying to install doc files individually from the source
      tree
    - consequently, drop libpam-doc.dirs as well which is no longer needed
      and no longer accurate
    - add debian/libpam-doc.install for moving the docs to the right place,
      and also replace libpam-runtime.files with libpam-runtime.install;
      for the moment this means we're using both dh_movefiles and
      dh_install...
    - libpam0g.docs: install the Debian-PAM-MiniPolicy from here, further
      cleaning up debian/rules
  * Drop debian/libpam0g.links, no longer needed because upstream now has a
    working install target which creates the library symlinks
  * Add libpam-modules.links: create pam_unix_{acct,auth,passwd,session}.so
    symlinks by hand, no longer provided upstream.
  * debian/patches-applied/PAM-manpage-section: "PAM" is not a daemon, manpage
    belongs in section 7, not in section 8.
  * Actually ship the pam, pam.conf, and pam.d manpages in libpam-runtime.
  * debian/patches-applied/autoconf.patch: move all changes to autotools
    generated files into a single patch at the end of the stack.
    - don't touch configure in debian/rules, the quilt patch takes care
      of this for us.
  * New patch 064_pam_unix_cracklib_dictpath: correctly define
    CRACKLIB_DICTS, since this is not defined by configure.  Thanks to Jan
    Christoph Nordholz.
  * New patch 065_pam_unix_cracklib_disable: Debian-specific patch to disable
    cracklib support in pam_unix.  Thanks to Christoph Nordholz.
  * debian/rules:
    - Rename OS_CFLAGS to CFLAGS.
    - kill off references to unused variables
    - make binary-arch also depend on the install target, and streamline the
      rules
    - fix up the clean target to not ignore errors; thanks to Roger Leigh
    - drop the local module_check target in favor of using -Wl,-z,defs
      in LDFLAGS to enforce correct linkage of all objects at build time
  * Drop debian/local/unix_chkpwd.8 in favor of the upstream manpage.
  * libpam-modules.files: /usr/sbin/pam_tally has moved to /sbin/pam_tally
    for consistency.
  * Update to debhelper V5.
  * Don't ship Makefiles as part of the libpam0g-dev examples.
  * libpam-modules.manpages, libpam-runtime.manpages, libpam0g-dev.manpages:
    put all the manpages in the correct packages.  Closes: #411812,
    #62193, #313486, #300773, #330545, #184270.
  * Drop libpam{0g,0g-dev,-modules,-runtime}.dirs, not needed for anything
    because we aren't trying to ship empty directories in the packages
  * Build-Conflict with fop, to avoid unreproducible builds of pdf
    documentation from a tool in contrib.
  * libpam-cracklib should depend on a real wordlist package, per policy;
    use wamerican as the default.
  * Drop local/pam-undocumented.7 from the package, since we no longer have
    a reason to ship it
  * Add lintian overrides for known false-positives
  * Conflicts/Replaces/Provides libpam-umask, now included upstream.
    Closes: #436222.
  * Upstream no longer marks unix_chkpwd suid-root for us, so set the perms
    by hand in debian/rules.  In the process, unix_chkpwd is now writable
    by the owner, as expected by policy.  Closes: #368100.
  * Migrate from db4.3 to db4.6; once again, no administrator action should
    be needed for upgrading on-disk database formats.  Closes: #354309.
  * Add XS-Vcs-Svn and XS-Vcs-Browser fields to debian/control; thanks to
    Laurent Bigonville for the hint.  Closes: #439038.
  * Add a watch file for use with uscan; thanks to Laurent Bigonville for
    this patch as well.  Closes: #439040.
  * Rewrite of 031_pam_include, fixing a memory leak and letting us drop
    patch 056_no_label_at_end; thanks to Jan Christoph Nordholz
    <hesso@pool.math.tu-berlin.de> for this much-improved version!
  * New patch no_pthread_mutexes: don't use pthread mutexes in
    pam_modutil functions, they're not needed because pam handles
    themselves should not be used concurrently by multiple threads and
    using pthreads causes problems for portable linking.
  * New patch hurd_no_setfsuid: if we don't have sys/fsuid.h, work around
    using setreuid instead.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 20 Dec 2006 16:14:37 +0000

pam (0.79-4ubuntu1) feisty; urgency=low

  * Resynchronise with Debian. Remaining changes:
    - Patch 100 (renumbered from 060): Look at ~/.pam_environment too, with
      the same format as /etc/security/pam_env.conf.
    - Patch 101 (renumbered from 061): Explicitly initialise RLIMIT_NICE
      rather than relying on the kernel limits. Bound RLIMIT_NICE from below
      as well as from above. Fix off-by-one error when converting
      RLIMIT_NICE to the range of values used by the kernel.
    - Add PATH to /etc/environment if it's not present there or in
      /etc/security/pam_env.conf.
    - debian/rules: Fix a bashism.
    - Install unix_chkpwd setgid shadow instead of setuid root. The nis
      package handles overriding this as necessary.
    - Use pam_foreground in the default session.
    - Linux-PAM/libpamc/test/regress/test.libpamc.c: Use standard u_int8_t
      type rather than __u8.

pam (0.79-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Medium-urgency upload; at least one RC bugfix, but also a
    significant number of changes, hence not urgency=high.
  * Move libpam-modules and libpam0g to Section: libs and libpam-runtime
    to section: admin, to match the overrides in the archive.
  * Move old changelog entries (well, entry) that don't follow the current
    format to debian/changelog.old, since there's no way to figure out a
    timestamp for an 8-year-old upload, and this is the most effective
    way to clear a glut of lintian warnings.
  * Fix the formatting of the libpam-cracklib package description.
  * Patch 010: remove parts of the patch that aren't necessary for C++
    compatibility.
  * Patch 060: fix a segfault in pam_tally caused by misuse of
    pam_get_data(); already fixed upstream.  Closes: #335273.
  * Patch 061: fix a double free in pam_issue, caused by overuse (and misuse)
    of strdup (similar to patch 059).  Already fixed upstream.
    Closes: #327272.
  * Don't build-depend on libselinux1-dev and libcap-dev on kfreebsd archs.
    Closes: #352329.
  * Patch 005: sync pam_limits with upstream:
    - support "-" (unlimited) for all limit types except process priority.
    - support the additional aliases "-1", "unlimited", and "infinity" for
      clearing the limits; closes: #122400, #149027.
    - restrict the range of process priority, login count, and system login
      count settings to (INT_MIN,INT_MAX) (heh).
    - special-case RLIM_INFINITY when applying multipliers to values from
      the config.
    - document maxsyslogins in the default limits.conf; closes: #149883.
    - use the current process priority as a default instead of resetting to
      0; closes: #241663.
    - add support for (and document) new RLIMIT_NICE and RLIMIT_RTPRIO
      settings in Linux 2.6.12 and above; closes: #313542, #313588.
    - allow imposing limits on uid=0.
  * Patch 027: only set RLIM_INFINITY as the default for the limits where
    we know this is sensible, so that recompiling in an environment with new
    limits doesn't create a security hole -- as happened with RLIMIT_NICE and
    RLIMIT_RTPRIO!  Thanks to Ville Hallik for the initial patch.
    Closes: #388431.
  * Patch 029, 047: Fix up the broken pam_limits capabilities patch so it
    actually works -- which may well be a first...  Closes: #318452.

  * Patch 059
    - Fix a segfault in pam_userdb when the new "crypt=" option
      is unset, as will be the case for all existing users; already fixed
      upstream.  Closes: #330829.
    - Fix a memory leak in the same code due to gratuitous strdup()s.
  * Further regression in pam_env: don't treat a missing /etc/environment
    as a fatal error, either.  Amend patch 058 accordingly.  Closes: #330852.

  * Switch pam_userdb from db3 to db4.3, which according to the libdb
    maintainers should require no manual intervention for upgrading on-disk
    database formats.  Closes: #165068.
  * Patch 058:  yes, of course we want to read /etc/environment by
    default.  Grr!  Revert upstream change which disables this for no
    apparent reason (closes: #330458).

pam (0.79-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (closes: #284954, #300775).
    - includes some fixes for typos (closes: #319026).
    - pam_unix should now be LSB 3.0-compliant (closes: #323982).
    - fixes segfaults in libpam on config file syntax errors
      (closes: #330097).
  * Drop patches 000_bootstrap, 004_libpam_makefile_static_works,
    011_pam_access, 013_pam_filter_termio_to_termios, 017_misc_fixes,

    integrated upstream.
  * Merge one last bit of patch 053 into patch 043, where it should have
    been in the first place
  * Patch 057: SELinux support:
    - add support to pam_unix for copying SELinux security contexts when
      writing out new passwd/shadow files and creating lockfiles
    - support calling unix_chkpwd if opening /etc/shadow fails due to
      SELinux permissions
    - allow unix_chkpwd to authenticate for any user when in an SELinux
      context (hurray!); we depend on SELinux policies to prevent the
      helper's use as a brute force tool
    - also support querying user expiration info via unix_chkpwd
    - misc cleanup: clean up file descriptors when invoking unix_chkpwd
      (closes: #248310)
    - make pam_rootok check the SELinux passwd class permissions, not just
      the uid
    - add new pam_selinux module (closes: #249499)
  * Build-depend on libselinux1-dev.
  * Fix pam_getenv, so that it can read the actual format of /etc/environment
    instead of trying to read it using the syntax of
    /etc/security/pam_env.conf; thanks to Colin Watson for the patch.
    Closes: #327876.
  * Set LC_COLLATE=C when using alphabetic range expressions in
    debian/rules; bah, so *that's* what kept happening to my README file
    when trying to build out of svn!  Closes: #295296.

  * Postscript pages are now generated correctly, closes: #41608
  * Moved to FHS compliance (including use of debhelper 2.0.40),
    this also raises the policy version to 3.0.1.1
  * Don't check the paths in /etc/pam.d files anymore. This is old
    and causes nothing but complaints, closes: #39747
  * Build libpam0g-dbg with debuggable static and shared libraries, also
    enabled the internal DEBUG_REL compile flag for these so that the
    debugging messages will also be output

pam (0.66-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added ability for pam_env to parse /etc/environment and updated
    docs to reflect it
  * Applied patch for pwdb_chkpwd man page, closes: #38976
  * Merged pam_unix_*.so modules into one pam_unix.so with symlinks
    for backward compatibility. This helps centralize this module the
    same way the pam_pwdb.so is and the way pam_unix.so is on other
    operating systems (commercial ones specifically).
  * Closed by pam-apps upload, closes: #38632
  * Fixed `sgml2latex' syntax, closes: #39119
  * Added doc-base support, closes: #37627

  *  SPARC NMU to fix chown symbols when compiling with glibc 2.1.1

 -- Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>  Tue, 11 May 1999 13:33:33 +0000

pam (0.66-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed the debian/rules to not mess with the library symlinks (ie
    running ldconfig in the lib dir) and all is well, closes: #36169

 -- Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>  Sun, 18 Apr 1999 09:09:51 -0400

pam (0.66-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Compiled with libpam_client.so now (seperate lib in libpam0g)
  * Made regex for libpam0g postinst a little more specific so it
    didn't flag false problems. closes: #34626
  * Applied patch to fix pam_ftp, closes: #35388
  * Modified pam_mail and pam_lastlog to honor PAM_SILENT in order to
    enable apps to use hushlogin/PAM_SILENT
  * Fixed problem with libpam_client.so being static

 -- Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>  Mon, 15 Mar 1999 20:54:23 -0500

pam (0.66-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed XCASE in pam_filter.c (not really in glibc 2.1 by default)

 -- Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>  Sat,  6 Mar 1999 18:46:56 -0500

pam (0.66-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed empty /lib/security/ from libpam0g (is created in
    libpam-runtime)
  * Added a depends for libpam-runtime to libpam0g (was supposed to be
    there, must have deleted it)
  * Removed empty /usr/bin from libpam-runtime (old directory where
    upperLOWER was)

 -- Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>  Wed, 24 Feb 1999 13:14:25 -0500

pam (0.66-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed harcoded libc6 dependency from libpam0g-dev and changed it to 
    libc6-dev. closes: #33615
  * Added md5 flag for pam_unix_passwd.so
  * Removed upperLOWER program since it is just an example. Moved it's
    source to the examples directory in libpam-modules
  * Fixed documentation of pam_strerror() and examples. closes #31142
  * Made pam_unix_passwd.so leave /etc/shadow mode 640 and root.shadow
    after changes
  * Fixed problem in pam_unix_auth that didn't let you su from a normal
    user to another normal user (ie. neither one was root)
  * Closing misc fixed bugs. closes #32809, #32274 (have been fixed,
    just need closing)
  * Tested lockvc with pam support, works for normal users (pam_pwdb)
    closes: #31150
  * Changed /var/log/wtmp in pam_lastlog docs to reflect correct
    /var/log/lastlog file. closes: #26544
  * Added -ldl to libpam.so, so apps don't have to

 -- Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>  Fri, 19 Feb 1999 18:47:30 -0500

pam (0.66-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed pwdb_chkpwd to sgid shadow instead of suid root since it only
    needs read permissions to /etc/shadow and not write.
  * Moved a lot of files arouns to get rid of libpam-runtime dependencies
  * Put libpam-pwdb into it's own package
  * Removed -lpwdb links for modules since libpwdb is somewhat buggy (or
    alteast it's interaction with libpam is)
  * Fixed bug in pam_unix_passwd.so that caused it to never authenticate
    the correct passwd, making it so you couldn't change the passwd

 -- Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>  Tue, 16 Feb 1999 15:50:28 -0500

pam (0.66-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed defaults in /etc/pam.d/other to be pam_unix_*.so modules instead
    of the accidental pam_pwdb.so module
  * Fixed suid of pwdb_chkpwd (had to move dh_fixperms after
    dh_suidregister)
  * Added Replaces: libpam0g-util in order to help dpkg upgrade from
    older packages
  * Applied glibc 2.1 patch from Christian Meder. closes: #32809
  * Moved libpam-doc to Section doc. closes: #32274

 -- Ben Collins <bcollins@debian.org>  Fri, 12 Feb 1999 02:01:43 -0500

pam (0.66-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed all of the versioned module stuff. Modules are now in
    /lib/security and stay there. Seems after discussion, that modules may
    not change as often as thought
  * Fixed suidregister for pwdb_chkpwd
  * Fixed incomplete descriptions in control file
  * This is a kludge to close some bugs since the last upload was yanked
    before being installed in the archive, closes: #16882, #30862, #7725,

pam (0.66-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer
  * New upstream release. closes: #16882, #30862, #7725
  * Created a better split of the main lib and the runtime to kill the
    circular dependencies and make it possible to have two .so version of
    the library installed for upgrades. closes: #10234, #10406, #12210,
    bug #14291, #15528, #15529, #20660, #25330, #29868, #31088, #31128,
    bug #9131, #9919.
  * Harcoded modules directory prefixed with the .so version, and
    used alternatives to create the symlink to the 'default' modules
    directory. libpam will use the full path when specified, but use the
    versioned modules directory for relative names.
  * Put libpam0g-cracklib modules back in (own package). This means that
    cracklib support is _not_ in the static libpam.a, also cracklib
    support is _not_ in pam_unix_passwd.o, but only in pam_cracklib.so
    by itself.
  * Fixed a few typos in the source causing compile errors
  * Fixed source #include's so that pam _didn't_ have to be installed
    in order to compile the source ( changed from <> to "" )
  * Removed empty directories from built packages
  * Opted not to build examples, only going to put *.c files in examples
    directory for libpam0g-dev
  * Moved *.sgml files for modules into their own directory (looks like
    that is what the original maintainer wanted to do, but it didn't go)
  * Moved doc build to arch-indep build in rules so that it doesn't get
    built when specifying -B with debuild/dpkg-buildpackage.
  * Moved `touch .quiet...' to build-stamp in order to have -B builds not
    ask about pam.conf
  * Split out non-standard modules to their own package, so as to make the
    base install smaller (planning for base inclusion here)
  * Created small manpage for pwdb_chkpwd. closes: #10941
  * The Copright file in /usr/doc/*/ was already named copright and not
    compressed. closes: #14533
  * Package is now lintian clean. closes #19383, #5132
  * There is a maintainer now and the patch for #25915 is still included
    so.... closes: #25915
  * Added check for editor backup files in /etc/pam.d (*~). closes: #28075
  * Applied patch for md5.h in pam_pwdb module. closes: #31548
  * Added support for dhelp in libpam-doc. closes: #31191

pam (0.65-0.8) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * Marked PAM as orphaned, given that there has been no maintainer upload
    in almost two years.
  * [defs/debian.defs] Removed superflous cracklib2 dependency.
    (Urgent as cracklib still has release-critical bugs).
    (Fixes #30862).

pam (0.65-0.7) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * Fixed security vulnerability in the pam_unix and pam_tally modules
    (reported by Michal Zalewski on bugtraq; patch 
    A000-SECURITY-PATCH-0.65-and-below.gz by Andrey V. Savochkin).

 -- J.H.M. Dassen (Ray) <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>  Tue, 29 Dec 1998 16:20:18 +0100

pam (0.65-0.6) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fixed distribution of files over the various packages, which was
    severely messed up.
  * Added appropriate Replaces: to ensure upgrading from both the hamm
    version and previous slink versions.
  * Fixed debug libraries, PAM module loading.
  * Added examples.
  * Added a "pam-undocumented" manpage pointing to libpam-doc, and
    made links for functions without a manpage to that.

 -- J.H.M. Dassen (Ray) <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>  Sun, 11 Oct 1998 19:29:40 +0200

pam (0.65-0.4) unstable; urgency=high

  * It looks like I misunderstood DEFAULT_MODULE_PATH: Linux-PAM does not
    currently seem to be easily configured to look for modules in more than
    one directory. With this version, it's configured to look only in
    /lib/security .

 -- J.H.M. Dassen (Ray) <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>  Fri,  9 Oct 1998 11:43:34 +0200

pam (0.65-0.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Moving the PAM modules to /lib/security broke netatalk.
    Added a preinst script to detect /etc/pam.d files with explicit paths to
    PAM modules, give a warning about them, and offer to abort the install
    (Fixes #27514).

 -- J.H.M. Dassen (Ray) <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>  Tue,  6 Oct 1998 20:10:43 +0200

pam (0.65-0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Argh. The tools didn't recognise -0.1 as a new upstream release, so
    my previous upload was rejected due to a missing .orig.tar.gz .

 -- J.H.M. Dassen (Ray) <jdassen@wi.LeidenUniv.nl>  Sun,  4 Oct 1998 17:15:09 +0200

pam (0.65-0.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Major package overhaul; now uses debhelper.
  * In experimental for now. *Please* provide feedback; if the feedback is
    positive, we can put this in slink.
  * Dropped libc5 support.
  * [libpam/pam_static.c] Fixed compilation: "pamh" was undefined; use "NULL".
    is this the correct fix?
  * [defs/debian.defs] New.
  * [Makefile]
    * Exit when a make in a subdirectory fails.
    * Compile statically too.
    * New variables: LC, LP, LPLIBS, DEFAULT_MODULE_PATH .
  * [libpam/Makefile]
    * Use DEFAULT_MODULE_PATH if nonempty.
    * Link libpam against LPLIBS.
  * [modules/*/Makefile]
    * Link the dynamic security objects against libpam and libc
     (LP and LC).
  * [modules/pam_pwdb/Makefile]
    * Link dynamic security objects against libcrypt and libnsl.
  * [conf/install_conf] Allow for non-interactive install (as the other
    install_conf scripts already did).
  * Automatically determine the list of /etc/security/* conffiles.
  * Moved libpam to /lib, and PAM modules to /lib/security as they will
    become part of the base system in the future.
  * Built without cracklib support, to keep the base system smaller.
  * /sbin/pwdb_chkpwd is undocumented, as is upperLOWER.

pam (0.57b-0.4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non maintainer upload
    My previous upload had removed the libc5 stuff from the controlfile
    messing up things. Change 'Architecture: any' to 'i386 m68k' for those
    .deb's instead.

 -- Turbo Fredriksson <turbo@debian.org>  Thu, 20 Aug 1998 20:06:50 -0400

pam (0.57b-0.3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non maintainer upload
    On a glibc2.1 system, XCASE is only defined in the <bits/termios.h>
    _IF_ '__USE_MISC' or '__USE_UNIX98' is defined.

pam (0.57b-0.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer release.
  * debian/control (Standards-Version): Updated to 2.4.0.0.
  * debian/control (libpam0g-dev): Also conflict with libpam-dbg.
  * debian/postinst: use case statement instead of if.
  * debian/rules (COMPAT_ARCHES): removed sparc.
  * debian/rules (binary-libc6-dev, binary-libc5-altdev): strip static libraries with
    --strip-debug, not --strip-unneeded.
  * debian/rules: each package now has it's own doc directory under
    /usr/doc/, containing at least the copyright file (Policy 5.6).
  * debian/rules: install files with `install -m 644' not `cp -p' to avoid
    read-only files.
  * debian/rules (binary-libc6-util): strip /usr/lib/*/security/*.so with
    --strip-unneeded.
  * debian/rules (binary-libc5-util): ditto.
  * debian/rules (binary-libc5): don't depend on binary-libc5.

pam (0.57b-0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer release.
  * New upstream version.
  * Doesn't use pristine upstream source as the upstream tar ball is broken.
  * Added libc6 libraries libpam0g, libpam0g-dev, libpam0g-dbg and
    libpam0g-util. [#11697]
  * libpam-dev becomes libpam0-altdev, libpam-util -> libpam0-altutil and
    libpam-dbg is removed.
  * libpam0 depends on libpam0g because libpam0g contains the pam conffile.
  * libpam0-util depends on libpam0g-util because libpam0g contains the binary.
  * Compiled with -D_REENTRANT and link with -lc.
  * Fixed permissions on shared libraries.
  * Corrected syntax of /etc/pam.d/other. [#10497, #10758, #12030]
